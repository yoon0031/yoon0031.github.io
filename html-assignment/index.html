      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <img id="my-image" src="images/yuni.jpg" alt="yuni">

      <p>I was born on November 18<sup>th</sup>, 2000 in Busan, a coastal city on the southeastern tip of South Korea, and grew up there until I was 22. I'm really a homebody, so in my free time I like to bake or paint at home. Or I like to go to nature where there are no crowds, so I like to go camping with my friends and family.</p>

      <p>I was a kid who loved music and art, and I went to an art high school and majored in composition. However, at some point, I started to feel a lot of pressure and decided that music was not my path. That's how I ended up in my current life in Canada.</p>
      <P>I'm pretty happy with my new program, <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>. I'm still not sure if I'm more interested in graphic design or web development, but I'm looking forward to enjoying the courses and finding out <em>what I like</em>.</P>
